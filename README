Important workflow information:


- Native pdb files:
  When using the --native option while --preparing, make sure the pdb file has
  been  adjusted to work with rosetta. This means that the residues have to be
  reordered  starting at 1, so that pdbslice.py takes the corrent ones. To
  achieve this, prepare the file using the rosetta tool:
    make_rna_rosetta_ready.py <native_pdb>

- Number of created structures in relation to the number of threads:
  The --nstruct parameter behaves differently for the motif generation and the
  assembly steps. Motif generation: The total number of structures is given and
  distributed among the threads. Assembly: Each thread is started with the
  total number of structures. The reasoning behind this is that the number of
  structures for assembly is not reached anyways. Instead, the current workflow
  uses a constant walltime.
